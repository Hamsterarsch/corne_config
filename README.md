[Zmk](https://zmk.dev/) firmware for [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) custom keyboard (60%) mapping all 100% keys.

Designed to enable use of more available US keycaps while retaining support for 'Umlaute'. The host OS layout is intended to be set to DE. The resulting mismatch of physical keys (US) to expected by host (DE) is bridged using zmk mod-morph behaviors.
(All german keys are mapped (except â‚¬). ALT code macros, which are not supported on all platforms/ipad OS and or require use of host software, are not used; however, on ipad OS, ^ and < keys are swapped).
